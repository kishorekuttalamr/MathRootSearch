Numerical Root Finding(Polynomial & Trancedental) Algorithms(C++) Repository


Welcome to the MathRootSearch repository, your go-to resource for efficient numerical root finding algorithms!

## About

Root finding is a common problem in mathematics and computational science. This repository aims to provide a collection of well-implemented algorithms to find roots of equations numerically.

## Algorithms

Explore a variety of root finding algorithms implemented here:


- **Bisection Method:** A numerical root-finding algorithm that repeatedly narrows down an interval by halving it, identifying a root when the function changes sign within the interval. While simple and reliable, it's generally slower compared to more advanced methods.(To utilize a different function, modify the mathematical function within the `bisection` function.)
- **Secant Method:** A numerical root-finding method that approximates the root of a function using two initial guesses and iterative calculations, often faster than the bisection method but sensitive to initial points.  


## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its own directory. You'll find clear documentation and usage instructions within each folder.

To run an algorithm:
1. Navigate to the algorithm's directory.
2. Follow the provided instructions to integrate the algorithm into your project.
3. Run the example code to see the algorithm in action.
